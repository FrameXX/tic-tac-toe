Currently availible on [https://jiri-kral.web.app/tic-tac-toe/index.html](https://jiri-kral.web.app/tic-tac-toe/index.html).

This is a Tic Tac Toe game as everyone knows it with a bit of customisation. You can set your own number of symbols in 1 line that a player needs to win (win combo) and you can also play against more than 1 player, which can be either another person or a computer.

## Controls
The bottom bar shows the current state of the game. It tells you who is playing, who has won, who should confirm their turn, etc. You can place your glyph on the board by simply tapping or clicking on the cell you have chosen. By default, touch screens require you to confirm your moves, but you can change this behaviour in the settings. This is to avoid missed moves where you accidentally tap the wrong cell, which can lead to frustrating experience.

## Options
As you may have noticed, there are many ways to customise your experience. There's a brief description under each option. Except for the grid sizes, any changes you make to the configuration will be applied to the game immediately, but I can't guarantee how well they will be applied to the game, so it's always a good idea to restart the game if you make major changes to the configuration. Also note that although you can change the values of some options manually by entering numbers, I cannot guarantee that values that cannot be set normally with the slider bar will work properly with the game. For example, negative values are usually not supported.
